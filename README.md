# Data-cleaning-and-manipulating-with-R-

There are two R files. 

First R file explores the R pakages which are useful for data cleaning and manipulation. Pakages it uses are -
#1.dplyr #2.data.table #3.ggplot2 #4.reshape2 #5.readr #6.tidyr #7.lubridate #8.purrr #9.stringr #10.broom #11.tibble

Second R file uses the data set "titanic" (attached with the file and is downloaded from Keggle). It shows basic use of some of the 
pakages discussed in part 1.
